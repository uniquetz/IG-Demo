This Immunization Implementation Guide for Product Suite focuses on Immunization Product Suite and aims to provide a common language across various audiences – programme managers, software developers, and implementers of digital systems to ensure a common understanding of the appropriate health information content within the immunization  health programme area, as a mechanism to catalyze the effective use of these digital systems. The key objectives of this Immunization Product Suite are:
    • to ensure adherence to public health and data use guidelines, and facilitate consistency of the health content that is used to inform the development of a person-centered digital tracking and decision-support (DTDS) system.
    • to enable health programme leads and digital health teams (including software developers) to have a joint understanding of the health content within the digital system, through a transparent mechanism to review the validity and accuracy of the health content; and
    • to provide a starting point of the core data elements and decision-support logic that should be included within DTDS systems for Immunization .
